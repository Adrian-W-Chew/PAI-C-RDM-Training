# PAI-C RDM Training
Principles Aligned Institutionally-Contextualised (PAI-C) Research Data Management Training

This repository contains resources for an institution to contextualise a principles-based RDM training with its institution's research data management policies, processes and systems.

The adoption of PAI-C across institutions will contribute to a common baseline understanding of RDM across institutions, which in turn will facilitate cross institutional management of data (e.g. when researchers move between institutions, and collaborate across institutions). 

# Background
Bond University, the University of New South Wales and the University of Sydney undertook a joint project to develop and pilot test a Research Data Management (RDM) introductory educational/training experience for Higher Degree Research (HDR) candidates that targeted minimum RDM training outcomes/competencies, and contains the respective universityâ€™s materials/information on policies, processes and systems.

The principles-based introductory RDM training was developed using the minimum RDM competencies identified in the Institutional Underpinnings (IU) Framework (Support, Training and Guidance Element) - see https://ardc.edu.au/program/institutional-underpinnings/
