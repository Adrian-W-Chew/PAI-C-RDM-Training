# PAI-C RDM Training
Principles Aligned Institutionally-Contextualised (PAI-C) Research Data Management Training

This repository contains resources for an institution to contextualise a principles-based RDM training with its institution's research data management policies, processes and systems.

The adoption of PAI-C across institutions will contribute to a common baseline understanding of RDM across institutions, which in turn will facilitate cross institutional management of data (e.g. when researchers move between institutions, and collaborate across institutions). 

# Background
The University of New South Wales (UNSW) designed, developed and rolled out a Research Data Management (RDM) online training for Higher Degree Research (HDR) candidates in 2019. Overall, the majority of the 643 candidates who completed the online training were satisfied with its quality and found it helpful – For more information, see Chew et al. (2022) https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/03400352211054120.

Spring boarding off UNSW’s RDM training experiences, Bond University, UNSW and the University of Sydney undertook a joint project to develop and pilot test an RDM introductory educational/training experience for HDR candidates that targeted minimum RDM training outcomes/competencies, and contains the respective university’s materials/information on policies, processes and systems. For details of the PAI-C design and development process, see [IU PAI-C Extension_V0.2.pdf](https://github.com/Adrian-W-Chew/PAI-C-RDM-Training/files/10531677/IU.PAI-C.Extension_V0.2.pdf)

The principles-based introductory RDM training was developed using the minimum RDM competencies identified in the Institutional Underpinnings (IU) Framework (Support, Training and Guidance Element) - see https://ardc.edu.au/program/institutional-underpinnings/

### PAI-C Storyboard

The top Yellow row for each section shows how the Principles version (bottom Green row) was contextualised for use at UNSW.

### Example: Interactive PAI-C Section 1

This provides a 'look and feel' of the translation of the PAI-C Storyboard into an online module. This interactive version can be deployed on most Learning Management Systems (i.e. Blackboard, Canvas and Moodle).
